  <p>I am a graphic designer whose interest in design started with his <b>own curiosity</b> in high school years. In high school years, I first started to be interested in programming and then in design, which I thought was more suitable for me. Later, I continued this interest by choosing the <b>graphic design department at the university.</b> When I started university, I also started working at the same time to gain real experience. I started my working life first in <b>design/product workshops</b> where I could improve myself, then as a <b>freelance designer</b> of companies at home and abroad. I also carried out <b>project-based</b> freelance work. I have continued to <b>work full-time</b> since I was close to completing my university education.</p>
  <p>I am a designer who values the <b>right design practices</b> and fundamentals and develops works in this direction with the awareness of having started design with his own interest. <b>I define myself as a "designer"</b> who focuses on <b>solving problems</b> rather than a standard graphic designer. I also like to <b>optimize development</b> processes thanks to my programming, linux and other deep computer skills. I can say that I am a designer who has an <b>organized and systematic approach</b> and focuses on efficiency and more effective work. I think that my interests and experiences in <b>typography, printing techniques and packaging design</b> also contribute to my work.</p>
